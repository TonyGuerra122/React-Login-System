# React-Login-System
 A test about what I have learned in my journey in Node.js and React.js

Important to remember about the ignored directories, which are "node_modules" by client.
The Node_modules are responsible for React's dependencies, so install React in a folder and copy node_modules to the "client" folder, after that install the following modules:
"axios" and "react-router-dom@5.1", using npm install.

Also, remember to have node.js installed on your machine. 

In addition, import node_teste.sql in your local database.
